Starting on the positive project by building it the North way.

VISION

We're building a place to share happiness.
No man is an island.
As a man-island, I want a place where I can share positivity when I have it. And find positivity when it eludes me.
The content is:
  1. adding positivity
  2. reading positivity

REQUIREMENTS

2 column layout on wide screens
responsive
200 character limit input box in left column
infinity scroll of messages in the right column

RELATIVE SIZE AND VALUE

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144

Size = 1

Value = 8

ESTIMATE

I think it will take me 2 hours to setup scaffolding to be ready for 8/15.
